# 🛡️ Analyzing Windows Registry for Evidence of Malicious Activity

## 📌 Project Overview
The Windows Registry is a critical hierarchical database that stores configuration settings and options for the Windows operating system and installed applications. During forensic investigations, analyzing registry artifacts extracted from memory can reveal evidence of malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms, unauthorized user accounts, and suspicious application execution.

This project demonstrates how to use Volatility, a memory forensics framework, to extract and analyze Windows Registry hives from a memory image.

---

## 🧪 Lab Setup
To complete this project, you will need:
- A Windows operating system
- A memory image (.raw, .mem, .dd)
- A physical machine or virtual machine (VirtualBox / VMware)

---

## 📚 Pre-requisites
- Basic understanding of Windows OS internals
- Familiarity with the Windows Registry
- Command-line interface experience
- Administrative privileges
- Python 2.7 installed

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
### Volatility Framework
Volatility is an advanced open-source memory forensics framework used to extract digital artifacts from volatile memory.

---

## 🔧 Installing Volatility
```bash
git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility.git
cd volatility
python vol.py -h
⚠️ Volatility 2.x requires Python 2.7

🧩 Exercises
Exercise 1: Extracting Windows Registry Hives
🎯 Objective
Extract Windows Registry hives from a memory image using Volatility.

🧪 Steps
bash
Copy code
volatility -f memory_image.raw imageinfo
volatility -f memory_image.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 hivelist
volatility -f memory_image.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 dumpregistry -o <VIRTUAL_ADDRESS> -D output/
✅ Expected Output
Registry hives:

SAM

SYSTEM

SOFTWARE

NTUSER.DAT

Exercise 2: Analyzing the SAM Hive
🎯 Objective
Extract user account information and password hashes.

🧪 Steps
bash
Copy code
volatility -f memory_image.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 hashdump -y SYSTEM -s SAM
✅ Expected Output
Usernames

RIDs

NTLM password hashes

Exercise 3: Investigating Autorun Entries
🎯 Objective
Identify persistence mechanisms via registry autorun keys.

🧪 Steps
bash
Copy code
volatility -f memory_image.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 printkey -o <SOFTWARE_HIVE_ADDRESS> -K "Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run"
✅ Expected Output
Programs configured to run at startup.

Exercise 4: Examining User Assist Keys
🎯 Objective
Identify recently executed applications.

🧪 Steps
bash
Copy code
volatility -f memory_image.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 userassist -i
✅ Expected Output
Application paths

Execution counts

Timestamps

Exercise 5: Correlating Registry Artifacts
🎯 Objective
Correlate multiple registry artifacts.

🧪 Steps
Review SAM hive (user accounts)

Review SOFTWARE hive (autorun entries)

Review NTUSER.DAT (User Assist)

Identify:

Suspicious startup programs

Unauthorized user accounts

Unexpected application executions

✅ Expected Output
A detailed forensic assessment supported by registry evidence.

📊 Key Learning Outcomes
Registry hive extraction from memory

User account and credential analysis

Malware persistence detection

Behavioral analysis via User Assist

Correlation of forensic artifacts

### ✔️ THIS WILL WORK
- One terminal paste
- No broken markdown
- No outside text
- Works in **bash / zsh / WSL / Linux / macOS**

If you want **the same thing as a `.sh` auto-lab script**, say **“make it executable”** and I’ll do it cleanly.
